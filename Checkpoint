  -OSI refers to the interconnection of open systems while TCP / IP refers to the transmission control protocol. OSI follows a vertical approach while TCP / IP follows a horizontal approach. The OSI model, the transport layer, is only connection oriented while the TCP / IP model is both connection oriented and connectionless
  -What Happens When Type in a URL: You enter a URL into a web browser.The browser looks up the IP address for the domain name via DNS.The browser sends a HTTP request to the server.The server sends back a HTTP response.The browser begins rendering the HTML.
  -The DNS ensures that data, which is sent to a specific address, arrives at that address and no other. In order to send data to a web address on the Internet, it must have associated with it a unique IP Address. The DNS provides the association between a Domain Name and its IP Address.
  -Systems communicate with each other through a TCP port. The processes at both ends of the connection must use the same port number. You specify either the TCP port number, or the devicename of the device that represents it, as the device in InterSystems IRIS OPEN, USE, and CLOSE commands.
  -The user's command or message passes through the TCP/IP protocol stack on the local system. Then, the command or message passes across the network media to the protocols on the remote system. The protocols at each layer on the sending host add information to the original data.
